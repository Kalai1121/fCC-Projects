# Building-a-pyramid-generator
I have gained knowledge in JavaScript, a powerful scripting language that allows me to make web pages interactive. As one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, I understand that all modern browsers support JavaScript.

In this practice project, I learned fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Pyramid Generator. I explored how to work with arrays, strings, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.
